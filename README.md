## Python, Bash and SQL Essentials for Data Engineering
### About this Specialization


If you are interested in developing the skills needed to be a data engineer, the Python, Bash and SQL Essentials for Data Engineering Specialization is a great place to start. We live in a world that is driven by big data - from what we search online to the route we take to our favorite restaurant, and everything in between. Businesses and organizations use this data to make decisions that impact the ways in which we navigate our lives. How do engineers collect this data? How can this data be organized so that it can be appropriately analyzed? A data engineer is specialized in this initial step of accessing, cleaning and managing big data.

Data engineers today need a solid foundation in a few essential areas: Python, Bash and SQL. In Python, Bash and SQL Essentials for Data Engineering, we provide a nuts and bolts overview of these fundamental skills needed for entering the world of data engineering. Led by three professional data engineers, this Specialization will provide quick and accessible ways to learn data engineering strategies, give you a chance to practice what youâ€™ve learned in integrated lab exercises, and then immediately apply these techniques in your professional or academic life.

### Applied Learning Project

Each course includes integrated lab exercises using Visual Studio Code or Jupyter notebooks that give you an opportunity to practice the Python, Bash and SQL skills with real-world applications covered in each course. For each data engineering solution that you explore, you are also encouraged to create a demo video and GitHub repository of code that can be showcased in your digital portfolio for employers.By the end of this Specialization, you will have the foundational skills necessary to begin tackling more complex data engineering solutions.
